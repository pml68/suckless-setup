# suckless-setup

My personal suckless setup.

- Palenight color scheme and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font by default (colors from [Palenight VSCode Extension](https://github.com/whizkydee/vscode-palenight-theme/))
- Custom keybindings:
    - Alt+Shift+D: Opens Discord
    - Alt+Shift+F: Opens Firefox
    - PrtScr: Opens Flameshot
