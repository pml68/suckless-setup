# suckless-setup
This is **not** original, but rather a modified version of [Mashed's](https://www.youtube.com/@MashedLinux) [setup](https://github.com/Edesem/Suckless) created to suit my needs.

This software belongs to [Suckless](https://suckless.org/).
## Things I added to his pre-existing setup([Showcase video](https://youtu.be/FOmoJAOOHHs))
- Palenight color scheme and JetBrainsMono Nerd Font by default (colors from [Palenight VSCode Extension](https://github.com/whizkydee/vscode-palenight-theme/))
- Custom keybindings:
    - Alt+Shift+D: Opens Discord
    - Alt+Shift+F: Opens Firefox
